      <h2>July 22, 2025</h2>
      <p> I'm not sure what else to put in there, I'm just doing a test run I guess. I wanted to write about my Europe trip and put some pictures online, just so I feel like I'm getting use out of such an expensive camera. 

      I also felt super inspired by my friend, James, who writes blog posts sometimes about random things that have happened or random things that he has done. It makes me want to document my life more and actually use my brain!</p>
